        <p class="intro-para">
            Utilizing the detailed dataset from the Palmer Archipelago, our task is to create a series of visualizations that articulate the 
            link between the dietary habits of Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins and their
            morphological features through the lens of δ15N and δ13C isotopic signatures. High δ15N levels indicate higher placement on the food chain, while δ13C levels differentiate from carbon sources in diets. Our data sourced from Kaggle, shows a comprehensive 
            report of three main types of penguin species - Gentoo, Adelie, and Chinstrap Our data contains 17 columns of data, with 
            344 data points for each penguins_size.csv provides us with morphological data about species type, culmen length and depth, 
            body mass etc penguins_iter.csv extends beyond this data providing insights about dietary patterns and isotopic signatures

                <p>In order to get a general overview of the population makeup of the penguins, we created this graph which 
                    demonstrates the spread of penguin types across the islands. There are 3 islands that the penguins inhabit: 
                    Dream, Biscoe and Torgerson. Each color grouping on the graph represents a species of penguin. From this visualization, 
                    we can see that adelie penguins are found on all 3 islands, whereas gentoo and chinstrap penguins are only found on one island each.

                <p>This graph shows the distribution of clutch completion among the 3 different islands. Clutch 
                    completion is a binary variable: describing whether a ‘clutch’ or nest of penguin eggs is fully formed. 
                    A completed clutch would indicate healthy penguins and sustainable population growth. While all 
                    islands have a majority of completed clutches, Biscoe Island has a noticeably higher rate of clutch completion 
                    and a lower rate of uncompleted clutches. Biscoe Island is made up of mostly Gentoo Penguins, who do not live anywhere else.
                     We can make an educated guess that Gentoo Penguins and their environment are responsible for this high rate of clutch completion.

                <p>This interactive visualization is a representation of the ratio of delta 15 N and delta 13 C within the penguins in the Palmer Archipelago. When you highlight a section of the graph, it will create a bar graph of the clutch completion separated by the species type. By interacting with the graph, we can see that there is a start difference in the Delta 15 N levels of the Gentoo penguins, and there is a lower amount of Delta 13 C in chinstraps. As we found before, the lower delta 15 N levels indicate a lower trophic level of diet, meaning that the gentoo penguin diet is largely krill. Looking at the clutch completion bar graph, we can see that the gentoo penguins also have a high clutch completion in relation to the other penguins.

                    positively correlated with body mass and flipper length. While physical size being correlated is expected, a more surprising 
                    correlation is between Delta 15 N and body mass/flipper length. With a -.54 correlation between body mass and Delta 15 N, larger 
                    penguins tend to have lower levels of Delta 15 N. This is surprising because lower levels of Delta 15 N indicate lower placement on the food chain.

            Summary
        </h2>
        <p class="summary-para">
            Our data visualization can provide deeper insight into the physical traits and dietary habits of penguin species. Our focus on the 
            Gentoo, Chinstrap, and Adelie penguins in the Palmer Archipelago has shown that Gentoo penguins are physically larger and have a 
            higher clutch completion. This leads us to believe Gentoo penguins are healthier and have a more sustainable population with high 
            survival rates. We also used Delta 15 N and Delta 13 C as a measure of penguin diets, and have shown that Gentoo Penguins have lower 
            Delta 15 N levels, while Chinstrap penguins have higher Delta 13 C levels. We were surprised about the negative correlation between 
            Delta 15 N levels and physical traits because we assumed larger penguins would be higher on the food chain. Gentoo penguins having lower Delta 
            15 levels could indicate them being lower on the food chain, meaning they are common prey. However, we found research to complement 
            our surprising visualization results. According to a study from the National Library of Medicine, penguin species have been abruptly 
            switching to lower-trophic (lower on the food chain) diets for the last 200 years. This could support our original idea that Gentoo 
            Penguins are healthy and also have high survival rates. The low levels of Delta 15 N could be due to them switching their diets, and 
            not due to a lack of survival on the food chain. In the future, we would like to continue this hypothesis on Gentoo penguins and other 
            species switching their diets. Using a different dataset with more physical variables and over a larger timeline would prove necessary. 
            It would also be interesting to use a dataset about the food hierarchy in this region to compare penguins’ traits with different animals 
            and make inferences on survivability and competition. This project touched upon the food chain dynamic, but it would be very interesting 
            to further this work. Research Links https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17620620/, https://www.kaggle.com/code/tirendazacademy/penguin-dataset-data-visualization-with-seaborn
